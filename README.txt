Audio-Cue-Scripts
=================

These are a series of scripts for manipulating audio files using Cue Sheets.  

Cue_Maker creates a .cue file (technical metadata for audio files that contains track times).

Cue_Splitter splits .wav files using the .cue file. It then converts the split tracks from .wav to .mp3, 
and names the tracks correctly. Must have Shntool installed.

CUE_GUI is a graphic user interface for running Cue_Maker and Cue_Splitter.
